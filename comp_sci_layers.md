**8. Virtual Machines**

* **Overview:** Software emulations of physical computer systems, allowing multiple operating systems or environments to run on a single physical machine. It provides an abstraction of hardware resources.

---

**9. Von Neumann Architecture**

* **Overview:** A computer architecture that uses a single address space for both instructions and data. It forms the basis of most modern computers.

---

**10. CPU and Logic Gates**

* **Overview:** The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer, executing instructions. Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of the CPU, performing basic logical operations.

---

**11. Boolean Logic Circuits**

* **Overview:** Electronic circuits that implement Boolean logic operations (AND, OR, NOT). They form the basis of digital electronics and computer hardware.

---

**12. Semiconductor Chips**

* **Overview:** Integrated circuits made from semiconductor materials (like silicon) that contain millions or billions of transistors. They are the physical realization of logic circuits and the foundation of modern electronics.

---

**13. Vacuum Tubes/Valves**

* **Overview:**
These were early electronic devices used as switches and amplifiers in the first generation of computers. They represent a foundational layer in the history of computing hardware, preceding transistors and semiconductor technology. They enabled the creation of electronic digital computers.
