**Computer Science - Layers**

---

**1. Computer Program (Solution)**

* **Overview:** The highest level of abstraction. Represents the final, executable software designed to solve a specific problem or provide a service. This is the user-facing layer, where all underlying abstractions come together.

---

**2. Solution-Level Abstractions**

* **Overview:** These are high-level conceptual models and architectural decisions made within the context of a specific software project. They include things like domain-specific languages, architectural styles tailored to the application, and overarching design philosophies.

---

**3. Application Framework (Building Blocks)**

* **Overview:** Pre-built collections of code, libraries, and tools that provide a structured foundation for building applications. These frameworks abstract away common tasks and provide reusable components, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

---

**4. Design Patterns**

* **Overview:** Reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a standardized way to structure code and improve maintainability, flexibility, and scalability.

---

**5. Programming Language**

* **Overview:** A formal language used to instruct a computer to perform tasks. They abstract away machine-level details, providing a more human-readable and manageable way to write code.

    * **5.1 Language Idioms**
        * **Overview:** Established coding practices and conventions specific to a programming language that promote clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
    * **5.2 Ecosystem: Modules/Libraries**
        * **Overview:** Collections of pre-written code that extend the functionality of a programming language, providing reusable components for common tasks.

---

**6. Operating System**

* **Overview:** Software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a platform for running applications. It abstracts away hardware details, providing a consistent interface for software.

    * **6.1 Containers**
        * **Overview:** A form of operating system virtualization that packages applications and their dependencies into isolated units, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

---

**7. IBM PC Architecture**

* **Overview:** Refers to the historical and still somewhat relevant architecture of personal computers based on the original IBM PC. This layer describes the hardware standards and conventions that shaped modern PC development.

---

**8. Virtual Machines**

* **Overview:** Software emulations of physical computer systems, allowing multiple operating systems or environments to run on a single physical machine. It provides an abstraction of hardware resources.

---

**9. Von Neumann Architecture**

* **Overview:** A computer architecture that uses a single address space for both instructions and data. It forms the basis of most modern computers.

---

**10. CPU and Logic Gates**

* **Overview:** The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer, executing instructions. Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of the CPU, performing basic logical operations.

---

**11. Boolean Logic Circuits**

* **Overview:** Electronic circuits that implement Boolean logic operations (AND, OR, NOT). They form the basis of digital electronics and computer hardware.

---

**12. Semiconductor Chips**

* **Overview:** Integrated circuits made from semiconductor materials (like silicon) that contain millions or billions of transistors. They are the physical realization of logic circuits and the foundation of modern electronics.

---

**13. Vacuum Tubes/Valves**

* **Overview:**
These were early electronic devices used as switches and amplifiers in the first generation of computers. They represent a foundational layer in the history of computing hardware, preceding transistors and semiconductor technology. They enabled the creation of electronic digital computers.
---

**14. Computer Science Theory**

* **Overview:** The theoretical foundation of computer science, including formal models of computation and analysis of algorithms.

    * **14.1 Lambda Calculus**
        * **Overview:** A formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application.
    * **14.2 Turing Machines**
        * **Overview:** A theoretical model of computation that defines what is computable.
    * **14.3 Algorithm Complexity**
        * **Overview:** The study of the resources (time and space) required to execute algorithms.
