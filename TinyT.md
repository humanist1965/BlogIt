## Introduction

In the lead-up to retirement (and as a welcome stress reliever), I'm embarking on a personal project to codify my understanding of computer programming. 
My focus will be on functional programming, a paradigm I find particularly compelling. 
This project is deeply inspired by the classic textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP), 
which served as the core text for [MIT's introductory computer science course, **6.001**](https://youtu.be/-J_xL4IGhJA?si=44la17hvzMYqE2Fn), 
for over two decades. 
I'm particularly interested in the recent JavaScript-based rewrite of SICP, having been familiar with the original Scheme version.

To further explore these concepts, I intend to create **TinyT**, a minimalist programming language based on a functional approach. 
TinyT will be a carefully chosen subset of TypeScript, leveraging its functional capabilities and built upon the foundational principles of Lambda Calculus. 
My initial experiments and notes on Lambda Calculus are available in this notebook: 
[https://github.com/humanist1965/deno/blob/main/jupyter/LambdaCalculus/lambda_calc.ipynb](https://github.com/humanist1965/deno/blob/main/jupyter/LambdaCalculus/lambda_calc.ipynb). 
This project will serve as a practical and deeply engaging way to solidify my knowledge and explore the elegance of functional programming.

## People influenced by SICP

The *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP) course from MIT (6.001) is one of the most iconic introductory computer science courses ever created. It was originally taught using the Scheme programming language and emphasized a deep understanding of programming principles and computational thinking.

While the course itself was taught to countless students at MIT, **a number of now-famous figures in tech and academia either took SICP or were influenced by it**. Here are some notable people associated with the course â€” either as students, teachers, or those who acknowledged its impact:

---

### ðŸš€ **Famous people who took or were heavily influenced by SICP**

#### 1. **Paul Graham**
- Co-founder of Y Combinator.
- Studied at Harvard and MIT.
- An advocate for Lisp (closely related to Scheme).
- He has praised SICP and the ideas behind it in his essays, especially *"Beating the Averages."*

#### 2. **Guy Steele**
- Co-creator of the Scheme language (which SICP uses).
- Though not a student of the course per se, his work underpins much of it.
- Also involved in creating Java and the Common Lisp standard.

#### 3. **Hal Abelson & Gerald Jay Sussman**
- The *creators* of the SICP course and textbook.
- Not students but legendary professors at MIT whose teaching shaped generations of programmers.

#### 4. **Bret Victor**
- While there's no direct evidence he took the course at MIT, he's cited SICP as a major influence in talks and writings about programming, interactivity, and design.

#### 5. **Peter Norvig**
- Director of Research at Google.
- He has praised SICP and similar deep-learning curricula as foundational to good CS education.

---

### ðŸ§  Why it's so influential:
Even for those who didn't take the course at MIT, **SICP is a rite of passage** in many elite CS programs. Its principles influenced:
- Functional programming evangelists
- Compiler designers
- AI researchers
- Early Lisp programmers
- Software architecture thinkers
