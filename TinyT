In the lead-up to retirement (and as a welcome stress reliever), I'm embarking on a personal project to codify my understanding of computer programming. 
My focus will be on functional programming, a paradigm I find particularly compelling. 
This project is deeply inspired by the classic textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP), 
which served as the core text for MIT's introductory computer science course, **6.001**, for over two decades. 
I'm particularly interested in the recent JavaScript-based rewrite of SICP, having been familiar with the original Scheme version.

To further explore these concepts, I intend to create **TinyT**, a minimalist programming language based on a functional approach. 
TinyT will be a carefully chosen subset of TypeScript, leveraging its functional capabilities and built upon the foundational principles of Lambda Calculus. 
My initial experiments and notes on Lambda Calculus are available in this notebook: 
[https://github.com/humanist1965/deno/blob/main/jupyter/LambdaCalculus/lambda_calc.ipynb](https://github.com/humanist1965/deno/blob/main/jupyter/LambdaCalculus/lambda_calc.ipynb). 
This project will serve as a practical and deeply engaging way to solidify my knowledge and explore the elegance of functional programming.
