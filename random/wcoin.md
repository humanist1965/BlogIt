# World’s U.S. Launch: A Satirical Take on Iris-Scanning Dystopia

Oh, rejoice, America! The glorious **World App** and its shiny **World ID** have finally graced your star-spangled shores, courtesy of Sam Altman’s latest dystopian pet project, *World* (née Worldcoin). It’s not just a digital ID—it’s a freakin’ *iris-scanning, blockchain-powered, human-or-AI litmus test* designed to save us all from the botpocalypse. Because nothing screams “freedom” like letting a metallic orb stare into your soul to prove you’re not a ChatGPT clone, right? 🦅💾

Picture this: you waltz into a *World Space* in Miami or San Francisco, let their NVIDIA-fueled **Orb** slurp up your eyeball data, and *poof*! You’re anointed with a World ID, a cryptographic hall pass that screams, “I’m a real boy, not a silicon Pinocchio!” Meanwhile, the World App—your one-stop shop for crypto, stablecoins, and mini-apps—promises to make you a global finance rockstar. Never mind that it’s built on Ethereum’s rollups and smells like a Silicon Valley fever dream to control every transaction from Boise to Bangladesh. 🌍💸

But let’s cut through the *horse shit*: this ain’t about empowering you, Joe Sixpack. It’s a Trojan horse for dominating world finance, dressed up as a “public utility.” Sam Altman, the AI messiah who gave us ChatGPT, now wants your irises to build a panopticon where every human is a verified cog in his blockchain machine. World ID? More like **World Control ID**. Prove you’re human, they say, while they rake in biometric data faster than a TikTok algorithm snags your attention. And the kicker? No WLD tokens for you, New Yorkers—geographic restrictions apply, because even utopia has fine print. 📜😒

Fuck you, Sam, and fuck this “inclusive” financial network that conveniently sidesteps the privacy concerns Europe’s been screaming about. Germany’s data watchdogs are side-eyeing this harder than a vegan at a butcher shop, but in the U.S., it’s all “Yee-haw, scan my eyes!” Why bother with pesky regulations when you can partner with **Visa** and **Tinder** to make sure your dating profile and your crypto wallet are both “human-approved”? Swipe right for decentralized domination, baby. 😘💳

In short, World’s U.S. launch is less about distinguishing humans from AI and more about turning your eyeball into a barcode for the global finance cartel. So, grab your tinfoil hat, America, because this steaming pile of futuristic *horse shit* is here
